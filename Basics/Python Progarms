A script are bunches of lines of code placed in files. They are useful for writing large programs. Modules can be defined and called in scripts. Generally in scripts there is a control function which is called. Although not necessary, this makes it neater, and is easier to debug.
Python scripts have a .py extension. In Mac you can run them by typing: python3 x.py
The .py file can be made an executable by running a chmod +x abc.py and setting '#! /usr/path/to/python' at the top of the file.
the sys module helps read in command line arguments and other input and output through the module. sys.argv gives a list of command line arguments passed. It also has an option parser to extract some specific commands from the arguments passed.
The python file can be distributed standalone, as executables by using py2app orfreeze.
